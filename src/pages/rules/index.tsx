                <p className='mb-2'>If a player shoots or passes the ball and directly forces an opposing player to put the ball in their own net, then an assist is awarded. If the pass or cross takes a significant deflection off an opposition player prior to their teammate scoring an own goal, then no Fantasy assist is awarded.</p>

                <p className='mb-2'>In the event of a penalty or free-kick being scored, the player earning the penalty or free-kick is awarded a Fantasy assist. However, if the goal is scored by the player who earned the penalty or free-kick, then no Fantasy assist is awarded.</p>

                <p className='mb-2'>For the avoidance of doubt, points awarded in-game are subject to change up until one hour after the final whistle of the last match of the Gameweek. Once the points have all been updated on that day, no further adjustments to points will be made unless under extraordinary circumstances.</p>
                <p className='mb-2'>The final decision on Fantasy assists is made by Fantasy Premier League in consultation with Stats Perform.</p>

                <p className='font-bold text-red-800 mb-2'>Bonus Points</p>
                <p className='mb-2'>The Bonus Points System (BPS) utilises a range of statistics to create a BPS score for every player. The three best performing players in each match will be awarded bonus points. 3 points will be awarded to the highest scoring player, 2 to the second best and 1 to the third.</p>
                <p className='mb-2'>Examples of how bonus point ties will be resolved are as follows:</p>
                <ul className='pl-8 list-disc	'>
                  <li className='mb-2'>If there is a tie for first place, Players 1 & 2 will receive 3 points each and Player 3 will receive 1 point.</li>
                  <li className='mb-2'>If there is a tie for second place, Player 1 will receive 3 points and Players 2 and 3 will receive 2 points each.</li>
                  <li>If there is a tie for third place, Player 1 will receive 3 points, Player 2 will receive 2 points and Players 3 & 4 will receive 1 point each.</li>
